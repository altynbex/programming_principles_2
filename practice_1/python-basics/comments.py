# This is a comment
# Comments in Python start with #

# ex 1: what do we use to implement a comment? - '#' sign

# ex 2: the visual code of a comment:

# This is a comment, that will be ignored

# ex 3, multiline comments:

a = '''
This is the multiple line comment, and this is actually a string

So it can be declared and even printed

''' 
print(a)

# Try it yourself
# this is a comment
print("Altynbek")

print("Altynbek") # < -- comment can be writed only after the code, otherwise the whole line will be a comment
